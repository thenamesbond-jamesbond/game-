# Game Planning

This folder organizes planning artifacts for the game.

## Structure
- `context.md` — project brief, constraints, target audience, tech stack.
- `roadmap.md` — versions, timelines, and goals.
- `backlog.md` — prioritized feature backlog.
- `milestones.md` — scoped milestones with deliverables.
- `acceptance_criteria.md` — template for feature criteria.
- `decision_log.md` — key decisions and rationale.
- `risks.md` — risk register and mitigations.
- `playtest_notes.md` — session notes and insights.

## Workflow
1. Update `context.md` first.
2. Draft `roadmap.md` targets from context.
3. Break down into `backlog.md` items.
4. Group into `milestones.md` with dates.
5. For each feature, specify criteria in `acceptance_criteria.md`.
6. Log decisions in `decision_log.md` and risks in `risks.md`.
7. Capture learnings in `playtest_notes.md` and feed back into backlog.
